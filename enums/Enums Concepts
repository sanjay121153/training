why we can not create the object of enum?
Answer :
Enums are used to define fixed number of instances i.e. pre-defined,
if we allow  some instance to be created, then this concept of having constant number of instances will fail.

Note: -
You can not create an instance of enums by using new operator in Java because the constructor of
Enum in Java can only be private and Enums constants can only be created inside Enums itself.

Question: can we define abstract methods in enum?
Answer:
Yes, we can declare the abstract methods in the enums.

Question: Why EnumMap and EnumSet is preffered over of HashMap and HashSet?
Answer: if we are using EnumMap instead of hashmap it uses ordinals to get the index and then it will put the values
    in the array index. it does not need to do hashing and comparing equals and hashCode for the checking the equality
    because it is already implemented in the enum, so because of this reason EnumMap and EnumSet would be faster.

Question: why enums are faster while comparing?
Answer: since enums are the constants so we can use == operator to compare them instead of equals so it would be fast.

Question: Why enum is useful in implementing Singleton?
Answer: because enum instances are the constants, so we can not have more than two same instance. that is how it guarantees the
    Singleton.
